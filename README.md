# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis

Here's a basic Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Brands project using Python. This project typically involves collecting tweets, cleaning the data, analyzing sentiment using libraries like TextBlob or VADER, and visualizing the results.

Below is a simple example using tweepy (for Twitter data), TextBlob (for sentiment analysis), and matplotlib (for visualization).

Here is a detailed note on Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Brands ‚Äî useful for understanding the concept, methodology, and applications. You can use this for documentation or as part of your project report.

# What is Sentiment Analysis?
 Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining whether a piece of writing (typically social media posts, reviews, or comments) expresses a positive, negative, or neutral opinion.

 # Importance for Brands.
  Monitor Brand Health: Understand how customers perceive a brand.

Reddit (posts, comments)

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Workflow of Sentiment Analysis Project


üîπ Step 1: Data Collection

APIs (e.g., Twitter API with tweepy)

Scrapers (where APIs are limited)

Public datasets


üîπ Step 2: Data Cleaning

Remove URLs, mentions (@), hashtags (#)

Remove stopwords, emojis, special characters

Normalize text (lowercasing, stemming, lemmatization)


üîπ Step 3: Sentiment Classification
Tools & Libraries:

TextBlob (Simple polarity: Positive, Negative, Neutral)

VADER (Specifically designed for social media text)

Transformers / BERT-based models (Advanced deep learning models)


üîπ Step 4: Visualization

Pie charts / Bar charts for sentiment distribution

WordCloud for common words/themes

Time series plots to track sentiment trends
