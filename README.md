# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis

Here's a basic Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Brands project using Python. This project typically involves collecting tweets, cleaning the data, analyzing sentiment using libraries like TextBlob or VADER, and visualizing the results.

Below is a simple example using tweepy (for Twitter data), TextBlob (for sentiment analysis), and matplotlib (for visualization).

Here is a detailed note on Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Brands — useful for understanding the concept, methodology, and applications. You can use this for documentation or as part of your project report.

# What is Sentiment Analysis?
 Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining whether a piece of writing (typically social media posts, reviews, or comments) expresses a positive, negative, or neutral opinion.

 # Importance for Brands.
  Monitor Brand Health: Understand how customers perceive a brand.

Crisis Detection: Quickly identify PR issues or negative trends.

Competitor Analysis: Compare sentiment with competitors.

Marketing Strategy: Tailor campaigns based on public sentiment.

Product Feedback: Analyze feedback to improve products/services.

     pip install textblob tweepy
     python -m textblob.download_corpora


# 2️⃣Python Code for Sentiment Analysis

    python                                                                                                            code

      from textblob import TextBlob
     import tweepy
     consumer_key = "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY"
    consumer_secret = "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET"
    access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    access_token_secret = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"

    auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
    auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
    api = tweepy.API(auth)

    def fetch_tweets(query, count=10):
    tweets = api.search_tweets(q=query, count=count)
    return [tweet.text for tweet in tweets]

    def analyze_sentiment(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
        return "Positive"
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity == 0:
        return "Neutral"
    else:
        return "Negative"

    if __name__ == "__main__":
      query = "Python"  # Replace with your search term
      tweets = fetch_tweets(query, count=5)
    
     for tweet in tweets:
          sentiment = analyze_sentiment(tweet)
         print(f"Tweet: {tweet}\nSentiment: {sentiment}\n")
        
# 3️⃣ Sources of Data
Common platforms used:

Twitter (most popular for sentiment due to public nature)

Instagram (comments, captions)

Facebook (posts, comments)

YouTube (comments)

Reddit (posts, comments)

# 4️⃣ Workflow of Sentiment Analysis Project


🔹 Step 1: Data Collection

APIs (e.g., Twitter API with tweepy)

Scrapers (where APIs are limited)

Public datasets


🔹 Step 2: Data Cleaning

Remove URLs, mentions (@), hashtags (#)

Remove stopwords, emojis, special characters

Normalize text (lowercasing, stemming, lemmatization)


🔹 Step 3: Sentiment Classification
Tools & Libraries:

TextBlob (Simple polarity: Positive, Negative, Neutral)

VADER (Specifically designed for social media text)

Transformers / BERT-based models (Advanced deep learning models)


🔹 Step 4: Visualization

Pie charts / Bar charts for sentiment distribution

WordCloud for common words/themes

Time series plots to track sentiment trends
